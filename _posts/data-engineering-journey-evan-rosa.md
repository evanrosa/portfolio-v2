> I’m a full-time professional and I still spend weekends writing code and building data pipelines—for fun. Why? Because I’m not just refining skills—I’m building the next chapter of my career, in public.

## Who I Am

Hi, I’m **Evan Rosa**, a data engineer with nearly a decade of experience architecting scalable batch and real-time data pipelines. I’ve worked in the public, non-profit, and private sectors for companies like **Digital Turbine**, **HHS/NIH via Booz Allen Hamilton**, and **The American Chemical Society**, where I designed cloud-native solutions powering over **3 billion monthly ad impressions** and supported **10 million+ daily users**.

My toolbox includes **Python, SQL, Apache Airflow, Spark, Kafka, and Flink**, and I’m diving deep into **Nessie** and **Apache Iceberg** to master versioned, modular data systems. I specialize in building dynamic, connector-driven ETL frameworks that are fast, flexible, and built to evolve.

## Why I’m Writing This Blog

I’m sharing my journey not just to showcase what I know—but to connect with others who care about building **cleaner, faster, more scalable data systems**.

This blog is my open notebook. I’ll walk you through:

- Projects I’ve built (code, architecture diagrams, real-world problems)
- Tools I use and why I choose them
- Lessons learned—both technical and career-wise
- How I’m navigating the path to a **senior data engineering role**

I’m a big believer in **building in public**. The tech world moves fast, and sharing what I’m learning (and struggling with) makes me better—and maybe helps you, too.

## What I’ve Built (So Far)

- **End-to-end ETL frameworks** using Airflow, Spark, BigQuery, and Python to reduce processing times and cut cloud costs by over **$100K**.
- **Streaming analytics systems** with Kafka, Flink, and Superset to power real-time insights for sports analytics and subscription platforms.
- **Composable, connector-based data pipelines** that dynamically ingest and transform data from APIs, cloud storage, and live streams.
- **Interactive dashboards** with Looker and Superset to help teams make sense of massive datasets.

## How I Think About Modern Data Workflows

The best data pipelines today are:

- **Modular:** Add or swap components easily.
- **Version-controlled:** Git-like rollbacks with tools like Nessie + Iceberg.
- **Self-serve:** Empower analysts, not just engineers.
- **Hybrid:** Real-time and batch working together—not either/or.
- **Built for trust:** Schema evolution, data testing, and observability baked in.

I believe **data engineers should own the user experience of data.** That means clean architecture, good docs, and fast feedback loops.

## What You Can Expect From This Blog

This isn’t a tutorial site (though I’ll share code). It’s a **real-world take** on what it takes to design, debug, and deliver data systems that scale—and grow with the business.

## Let’s Build Together

Whether you’re another data builder, a hiring manager looking for senior talent, or someone just breaking into the field—welcome.  
Let’s learn, share, and grow together.

**Follow along** if you want to level up your data stack—and see what it takes to build pipelines with purpose.
