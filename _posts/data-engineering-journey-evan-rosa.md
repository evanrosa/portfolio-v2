> Even after a full week of work and family life, I spend my weekends tinkering with data pipelines—not because I have to, but because this is how I level up. I'm not just refining skills—I’m writing the next chapter of my career, in public.

## Who I Am

Hey there—I’m **Evan Rosa**, a data engineer with nearly 15 years of experience in the data space designing, building, and scaling data systems across the public, private, and nonprofit sectors.

I’ve architected cloud-native solutions for:

- **Digital Turbine**, where I helped drive over **3 billion monthly ad impressions**
- **HHS/NIH (via Booz Allen Hamilton)**, supporting data integrity in critical health research
- **The American Chemical Society**, building systems to track engagement to their 80+ peer reviewed journals.

My toolkit includes **Python, SQL, Airflow, Spark, Kafka, Flink**, and lately I’ve been getting my hands dirty with **Apache Iceberg** and **Project Nessie** to bring version control into the modern data stack. I focus on building flexible, connector-driven ETL frameworks that scale—because brittle pipelines simply don't work.

## Why I’m Writing This Blog

I’m not just sharing to show off what I’ve built—I’m sharing to **connect**.

This blog is my digital workbench: part journal, part lab notebook, part blueprint. I’ll walk you through:

- Projects I’ve built—with architecture diagrams, code, and real-world lessons
- Tools I’ve adopted (and abandoned), and why
- Thoughts on what makes great data engineering
- My personal roadmap toward an **advanced data engineering role at a mission-driven company**

I believe in **building in public**—because the best ideas get sharper when shared. If something I’ve wrestled with helps you debug your own pipeline, that’s a win.

## What I’ve Built (So Far)

I’ve led and contributed to systems like:

- **Cost-efficient ETL frameworks** with Airflow, Spark, and BigQuery, slashing cloud bills by over **$100K**
- **Streaming analytics pipelines** using Kafka and Flink to support real-time dashboards in sports tech and subscription platforms
- **Composable, connector-based ingestion frameworks** pulling data from APIs, GCS, S3, and live event streams
- **Self-serve analytics layers** with Looker and Superset to help non-technical teams explore data confidently

These aren’t portfolio projects—they’re solutions to business-critical challenges, delivered in production environments with real stakes.

## How I Think About Modern Data Workflows

To me, the best pipelines aren’t fragile contraptions—they're **well-oiled machines** built for change. They should be:

- **Modular**: Swap in new tools without rewriting your stack
- **Version-controlled**: Git-like rollbacks for data models using Nessie and Iceberg
- **Hybrid**: Real-time and batch playing nicely together
- **Self-serve**: So analysts aren’t left waiting on pull requests
- **Observable and testable**: Because trust in data is earned, not assumed

In short: **Data engineers should be user experience designers**—not just of dashboards, but of the pipelines themselves.

## What You’ll Find Here

This isn’t another “hello world” blog.

Instead, I’ll offer:

- Hard-won insights from real-world projects
- Architectural patterns that stand up to scale
- Thoughts on building resilient, elegant data systems
- Ideas on career growth, tooling, and staying sharp in a fast-moving field

If you’re looking for practical, thoughtful takes on modern data engineering—you’re in the right place.

## Let’s Build Together

Whether you’re a fellow builder, a hiring manager looking for a senior engineer, or someone just starting out—welcome.

Let’s share what we know, learn what we don’t, and build something better—together.

**Follow along** if you’re curious about how great pipelines are built—and what it means to build them with purpose.
